# Book a meeting

Ready to connect? Reach out to tumbleweedpioneer AT gmail DOT com to set up a meeting.

Our conversation might be about any of the following things:

* Business services inquiry: You have ghostwriting or editing needs and we discuss fit and a potential collaboration.
* Communication coaching: You are looking specifically for insight and guidance on which tools and frameworks to use in order to deliver an effective message for a given context and audience.
* There are topics from my [newsletter or podcast](https://tumbleweedpioneer.substack.com/) that you would like to discuss further.
* General advice on starting a business that is highly integrated with a creative practice.
* A chance to connect and discuss things that matter to us both!
