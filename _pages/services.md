## How we work 
Investigate: We use a “discovery” approach to work backwards from your vision, mission, or goals. 
Coordinate: Once we understand the shape of your desired destination, we make a plan for how to arrive. 
Iterate: We have regular check-ins for review and feedback, working through drafts and refining as we go. 
Celebrate: Once we have a finished product, we take the final implementation steps.
