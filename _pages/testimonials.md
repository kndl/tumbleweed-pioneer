# Testimonials 

Here’s what people are saying about Tumbleweed Pioneer and working with Emiliane … 

## From business owners … 
“Emily is an incredible communicator, and makes me feel like one too. Her level-headed advice has clarified business and personnel situations that felt like crazy tangles, and given me a confident way forward. She's an incredible listener, and asks questions that help me get to the heart of what's going on. I can tell that she honestly wants to help, and that she's invested in helping me succeed in my own way, while never pushing me to change who I am. I always come away from our talks feeling supported and heard, and with a better understanding of my own thinking and direction.” - Ros O’Brien, Founder & Owner of [Friendly City Clay & Art Center](https://www.friendlycityclay.com/)

“There’s something so incredibly special about my interactions with Emily that I can’t quite even put into words - which is,  ironically, why I've needed her. She has this profound intuition and a natural way of quickly understanding my complicated ideas and emotions.  She can almost instantaneously make sense of problems and reflect them back to me in a way that makes me feel profoundly understood, which then helps me find clarity in my life. Every conversation I’ve ever had with her leaves me with more purpose and confidence. From the very first time I spoke with her, I felt mutual understanding and connecting. It just flows so effortlessly. And I’ve witnessed her be able to do this with just about everyone she meets. 
Her coaching style feels safe, human and authentic. This woman just understands so many of the complicated mysteries of our human condition and can explain them in language that is so approachable and digestible and can pull it out of just about anybody. She’s a communication artist. A linguistic magician. And all her gifts emanate from such a sincere place. What started out as a coaching relationship to help me become a better writer and express my ideas in newsletters has turned into a life-changing working relationship and friendship. Emily inspires me to be true to myself and never settle for anything less.” - Leigh Weinraub, [HumanLeigh](http://humanleigh.com)

## From workshop participants … 
What I loved most [about the workshop] were the weekly meetings. I really felt like I got SO MUCH out of our conversations. The space you created in those hour segments was really special. I feel I connected with deeper parts of myself and learned more about you and your wisdom! It also felt like a very safe space to get vulnerable and share words with a fellow creative. While I believe the intended purpose of the course was to help me get loose and writing without pressure, I actually found the sessions to be a form of healing specifically for the creative soul. There are so few spaces as an adult to come together with another person and get deep into the creative mindset. I think you have something special here! In order to have creative output, we need to input into ourselves. I felt fed after every meeting. - Berlin Burkhart, [berlinmichelleart](https://www.instagram.com/berlinmichelleart/?igsh=MXhvd3h0bmYzaWRvag%3D%3D#)

## From memoir writers … 
“Emily has been an incredible source of support throughout my memoir-writing process. Her regular meetings keep me on track, and her encouragement helps me navigate the emotional depth of my story with confidence. I couldn’t have done this without her!” - Rose Cardella, _Inside These White Walls_
