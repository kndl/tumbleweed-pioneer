# Mission 
I believe that humans connect to one another through how they represent their experiences. My mission is to unite the individual or organization with their broader community by delivering a message crafted with precision. Communication is a power available to everyone who is ready to welcome clarity. 

# About
Tumbleweed Pioneer is a writing, editing, and communication services business that connects people with purpose through content. I specialize in supporting non-fiction writers, working with entrepreneurs and startups to grow their business, and intuition-based communication coaching for business leaders and executives. 

I'm Emily Anne Nava, and I founded Tumbleweed Pioneer in 2023 in response to an increased demand for my writing and communication coaching services. My background includes a PhD in Linguistics, a stint as a journalist in foreign countries, and a fifteen-year career in the tech industry.

In addition to writing the [Tumbleweed Pioneer Substack](https://tumbleweedpioneer.substack.com/), I facilitate an in-person and a virtual writers circle, and host writing and creative workshops. Check out upcoming dates and past themes: [My life prompted workshop](https://mylifeprompted.com/)
